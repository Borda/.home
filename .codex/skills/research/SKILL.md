# Research

Run a linear research loop with source validation.

## Workflow

1. Define research question and constraints.
2. Gather primary sources.
3. Summarize findings with citations, confidence, and explicit caveats where sources are incomplete or stale.
4. Translate findings into actionable next steps.
5. Decide gate result (`pass` or `fail`).
6. Write artifact to `.reports/codex/research/<timestamp>/result.json`.

## Output Contract

Use shared gate schema from `../_shared/quality-gates.md`.

Minimum artifact payload:

```json
{
  "status": "pass|fail",
  "checks_run": [
    "review"
  ],
  "checks_failed": [],
  "findings": {
    "critical": 0,
    "high": 0,
    "medium": 0,
    "low": 0
  },
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "artifact_path": ".reports/codex/research/<timestamp>/result.json"
}
```
