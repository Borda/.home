# Analyse

Run a linear analysis loop.

## Workflow

1. Define the analysis question and scope.
2. Gather evidence from code, diffs, and optional external sources.
3. Produce structured findings, confidence, and explicit gaps or hypotheses where evidence is incomplete.
4. Run required checks from `../_shared/quality-gates.md`.
5. Decide gate result (`pass` or `fail`).
6. Write artifact to `.reports/codex/analyse/<timestamp>/result.json`.

## Output Contract

Use shared gate schema from `../_shared/quality-gates.md`.

Minimum artifact payload:

```json
{
  "status": "pass|fail",
  "checks_run": [
    "review"
  ],
  "checks_failed": [],
  "findings": {
    "critical": 0,
    "high": 0,
    "medium": 0,
    "low": 0
  },
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "artifact_path": ".reports/codex/analyse/<timestamp>/result.json"
}
```
