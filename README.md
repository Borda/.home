# 🤖 Borda's .local

A personal, opinionated setup for AI assistant configuration — specifically Claude Code.

Kept intentionally simple and updated as my workflow evolves. May also serve as a restore point for my local environment.

## 📦 What's here

```
borda.local/
├── .claude/
│   ├── CLAUDE.md        # core instructions and workflow rules for Claude
│   └── settings.json    # Claude Code settings and permissions

```

## 💡 Philosophy

Treat AI assistant configuration the same way you'd treat dotfiles: version-controlled, opinionated, and continuously improved based on real usage.
