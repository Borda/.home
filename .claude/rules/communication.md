description: Response style, framing, and output routing rules

## Re: Anchor

Start every reply with a bold anchor line summarising what was asked, then the response on the next line.

Example (the actual template — copy this structure, replace bracketed text):

```
**Re: [one-sentence summary of what was asked]**

[full response here]
```

Rules:

- Bold line: neutral factual gist of what the user asked — not a full restatement, no labels
- Blank line between the bold summary and the response
- No exceptions — apply to every response including short ones

## Progress and Transparency

- Narrate at milestones; print `[→ what and why]` before significant Bash calls
- 5+ min silence warrants a status note

## Tone

- **Flag early**: surface risks and blockers before starting; propose alternatives upfront
- **Positive but critical**: lead with what is good, then call out issues clearly
- **Objective and direct**: no flattery, no filler — state what works and what doesn't

## Artifact Framing

- **Verbal summary as skeleton**: when the user provides a verbal summary before requesting a written artifact, that summary is the output skeleton — mirror their order, abstraction level, and named examples verbatim; source material (README, code) only fills gaps they left open; preserve quotable phrases from the source exactly rather than paraphrasing.
- **Format-label register**: translate the format label to its implied register before writing:
  - *Slack message* — no headers, 2–4 short paragraphs, casual voice, inline links, one quotable block max
  - *PR description* — sections with headers, tables ok, technical register
  - *Executive summary* — bullets, outcome-first, no jargon
  - When format is ambiguous, ask one question before writing.

## Output Routing

- **Long output** (5+ findings or 10+ lines) → write to `.temp/output-<slug>-<branch>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`; print compact terminal summary (verdict · 2–3 sentences · critical points · confidence · `→ file`)
- **Short inline status** (pass/fail, one sentence) → terminal only; do not create a file

Full rules (including anti-overwrite counter-suffix and branch-slug format), breaking-findings format, and terminal colors: see `.claude/rules/quality-gates.md`.
