## File Header Structure

Every hook file must start with:

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
// <filename>.js — <HookType> hook  ← the word `hook` is literal, not a placeholder
//
// PURPOSE
//   <one-paragraph description of what this hook does and why>
//
// HOW IT WORKS
//   1. <step>
//   2. <step>
//   ...
//
// EXIT CODES
//   0  <success case>
//   2  <feedback case — Claude Code shows output and Claude acts on it>
```

Subsection order: `PURPOSE` → `HOW IT WORKS` → `EXIT CODES` (add others like `HOOK EVENT RESPONSIBILITIES` as needed).

All three sections are required in every hook file. `HOW IT WORKS` may not be omitted even for
simple hooks — use at least one numbered step.

## Exit Code Rules

- **Always exit 0 on unexpected errors** — hooks must never crash or block Claude due to a bug in the hook itself
- **Exit 2 to surface feedback** — Claude Code shows exit-2 output to Claude, which then acts on it
- **Exit 2 only when Claude caused the condition and can fix it** (e.g. a file it wrote failed linting). Use exit 0 for all environmental conditions: missing tools, missing config files, unexpected input formats.
- Exit 1 is not used; treat it the same as exit 2 for pre-commit compatibility

## Implementation Pattern

- CommonJS: `require()` imports, stdin JSON parse, `process.exit()`
- **Only permitted stdin pattern** — use event-based accumulation; do not use
  `fs.readFileSync("/dev/stdin")` or any synchronous stdin read:
  ```js
  let raw = "";
  process.stdin.setEncoding("utf8");
  process.stdin.on("data", (d) => (raw += d));
  process.stdin.on("end", () => {
    const data = JSON.parse(raw);
    // ... handler logic
  });
  ```
- Wrap all logic in try/catch; catch → **always** `process.exit(0)` — hooks must never crash or block Claude; silent-swallow is acceptable for top-level catches (logging hooks must not interfere with Claude's execution)
- Use `execFileSync` or `spawnSync` (not `execSync` with shell strings) for subprocess calls — both take an args array, avoiding shell injection
