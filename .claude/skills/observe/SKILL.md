<objective>

Analyze how Claude Code is being used in this project and suggest new agents or skills that would reduce repetition, improve quality, or handle specialized domains — without duplicating what already exists.

</objective>

<inputs>

- **$ARGUMENTS**: optional. Three modes:
  - Omitted — analyze the project's existing patterns and agents to generate suggestions proactively.
  - `review` — review the existing agent/skill roster for quality and gaps without suggesting new additions.
  - Description of a recurring task — use the description as context when generating suggestions (e.g. "I keep doing X manually").

</inputs>

<workflow>

## Step 1: Inventory existing agents and skills

```bash
ls .claude/agents/*.md
ls .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md
```

For each agent/skill found, extract: name, description, tools, purpose.

## Step 2: Analyze work patterns

**If `$ARGUMENTS` is `review`**: skip the git analysis below and go directly to Step 3 (Gap analysis). Use the agent/skill descriptions from Step 1 as the sole input — the goal is to assess quality and coverage of the existing roster, not to look for new patterns in recent work. In Step 5, suppress all "Recommend: New Agent/Skill" sections and output only "Existing Coverage", "Recommend: Enhance Existing", and "No Action Needed" entries.

Otherwise, look for signals of repetitive or specialist work. The first three git commands are independent — run them in parallel:

```bash
# --- run these three in parallel ---

# Recent git history — what kinds of changes are common?
git log --oneline -50

# What file types are being worked on?
git log --name-only --pretty="" -30 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20

# Commit message patterns — what verbs appear most?
git log --oneline -100 | awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -15
```

```bash
# Then read task history and conversation hints
cat tasks/todo.md tasks/lessons.md 2>/dev/null
```

If `$ARGUMENTS` was provided, use it as additional context for the pattern analysis.

### Frequency Heuristics

- **3+ occurrences** of a pattern in recent history → candidate for automation
- **2+ different projects** using the same manual process → cross-project skill
- **> 10 minutes** of manual work per occurrence → high-value automation target
- **Domain-specific knowledge** required → candidate for a specialist agent (not just a skill)

## Step 3: Gap analysis

For each identified pattern, check:

1. **Is it already covered?** — search existing agent/skill descriptions for overlap
2. **Is it frequent enough?** — recurring ≥ 3 times or clearly domain-specialized
3. **Would a specialist add quality?** — does it require deep domain knowledge?
4. **Is it too narrow?** — a single-use task doesn't warrant a persistent agent

Thresholds for recommendation:

- **New agent**: recurring specialist role, complex decision-making, 5+ distinct capabilities
- **New skill**: workflow orchestration, multi-step process with fixed structure
- **No new file needed**: one-off or already covered by existing agent

## Step 4: Check for duplication

Before recommending anything:

```
For each candidate agent/skill:
- Does any existing agent cover >50% of its scope? → enhance existing instead
- Is the name/description confusingly similar to an existing one? → rename existing
- Does it overlap with a GitHub Copilot agent? → acceptable if serving different tool
```

## Step 5: Report

```
## Agent/Skill Suggestions

### Existing Coverage (no gaps found)
- [agent/skill]: covers [pattern] well — no new file needed

### Recommend: New Agent — [name]
**Trigger**: [what recurring pattern or gap justifies this]
**Gap**: [what existing agents don't cover]
**Scope**: [what it would do — 3-5 bullet points]
**Suggested tools**: [Read, Write, Edit, Bash, etc.]
**Draft description**: "[one-line description for frontmatter]"

### Recommend: New Skill — [name]
**Trigger**: [what repetitive workflow justifies this]
**Gap**: [why existing skills don't cover it]
**Scope**: [what workflow steps it would orchestrate]
**Draft description**: "[one-line description for frontmatter]"

### Recommend: Enhance Existing — [agent/skill name]
**Add**: [specific capability missing from current version]
**Why**: [what recurring task would benefit]

### No Action Needed
[pattern]: already handled by [existing agent/skill]
```

## Decision Criteria

### When to Create a New Agent (specialist role)

- Has a distinct persona, expertise, or decision-making style
- Would be invoked for a class of tasks, not a single workflow
- Benefits from deep domain knowledge in its system prompt
- Examples: `benchmark-runner`, `migration-guide`, `dependency-auditor`

### When to Create a New Skill (workflow)

- Has a fixed multi-step process that spawns sub-agents or runs commands
- Is invoked ad-hoc for a specific task type
- Benefits from structured output format
- Examples: `analyse`, `review`, `release`

### When to Do Nothing

- Task is handled well by an existing agent with slight prompt adjustment
- Too project-specific to be reusable
- One-off task that won't recur

### Anti-patterns to Avoid

- Creating an agent for every different topic (agents are roles, not tasks)
- Duplicating an existing agent with a slightly different name
- Creating a skill that just calls one agent with fixed args (not enough value)

</workflow>

<notes>

- This skill is introspective: it looks at the tooling itself, not just the code
- Run periodically (e.g., monthly) or after noticing repetitive manual work
- Suggestions are proposals — always review before creating new files
- After creating a new agent/skill based on a suggestion, re-run this skill to verify coverage improved
- Follow-up chains:
  - Suggestion accepted for new agent/skill → `/manage create` to scaffold and register it
  - Suggestion to enhance existing → edit the agent/skill directly, then `/sync`
