# File-Based Handoff Protocol

## When to apply

- Any skill spawning **2+ agents in parallel** for analysis or review
- Any **single agent** expected to produce >500 tokens of findings/analysis
- Exception: implementation agents (writing code) return inline — their output IS the deliverable
- Exception: single-agent single-question spawns where output is inherently short (\<200 tokens)

## Agent contract

The spawned agent **must**:

1. Write full output (findings, analysis, Confidence block) to `<RUN_DIR>/<agent-name>.md` using the Write tool
2. Return to the orchestrator **ONLY** a compact JSON envelope on the final line — nothing else after it:

```json
{
  "status": "done",
  "findings": 3,
  "severity": {
    "critical": 0,
    "high": 1,
    "medium": 2
  },
  "file": "<path>",
  "confidence": 0.88
}
```

Include any additional task-specific keys (e.g. `"papers":5` for survey, `"verdict":"approve"` for review) but keep the envelope ≤200 bytes.

## RUN_DIR convention

- **Ephemeral** (per-run): `/tmp/<skill>-<timestamp>/` — created once before any spawns: `mkdir -p /tmp/<skill>-$(date +%s)`
- **Persistent** (reports): `tasks/` — for final consolidated reports that survive the session

## Orchestrator contract

1. **Do NOT read agent files back into main context for consolidation** — delegate to a consolidator agent instead
2. Collect the compact envelopes from each spawn (these are tiny — they stay in context)
3. Use envelopes to decide which files need further action (e.g., files with critical findings)
4. Spawn a **consolidator agent** to read all `<RUN_DIR>/*.md` files and write the final report

## Consolidator threshold

- **4+ agent files** → mandatory consolidator; consolidator reads all files and writes the final report
- **2–3 agent files** → orchestrator may read files directly **only if** total expected content is \<2K tokens
- Consolidator agent type: same domain as the lead reviewer (e.g., `sw-engineer` for code review, `self-mentor` for config audit)

## Consolidator prompt template

```
Read all finding files in `<RUN_DIR>/`. Apply the consolidation rules from <checklist path>.
Write the consolidated report to `<output path>` using the Write tool.
Return ONLY a one-line summary: `verdict=<VALUE> | findings=N | critical=N | high=N | file=<path>`
```

Main context receives only the one-liner.

## Envelope fields reference

| Field        | Required | Description                                |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `status`     | yes      | `"done"`, `"timed_out"`, `"error"`         |
| `findings`   | yes      | total finding count (0 if none)            |
| `severity`   | yes      | `{"critical":N,"high":N,"medium":N}`       |
| `file`       | yes      | absolute path to the written findings file |
| `confidence` | yes      | agent's self-reported confidence (0–1)     |

## Reference implementation

`/calibrate` is the canonical example of file-based handoff at scale — agents write to `/tmp/calibrate-<id>/` files; the orchestrator collects one-line summaries; consolidation happens post-collection without flooding main context.

See also `/audit` Step 3 (`self-mentor` agents per file → `<RUN_DIR>/<file-basename>.md`) and `/review` Step 3–6.
