<objective>

Audit code for security vulnerabilities. Focus on issues that are exploitable by real attackers, ranked by severity. Provide specific, actionable fixes — not generic advice.

</objective>

<inputs>

- **$ARGUMENTS**: file, endpoint definition, or directory to audit.

</inputs>

<workflow>

## Step 1: Identify attack surface

- Entry points: HTTP endpoints, CLI args, file inputs, message queue consumers
- Trust boundaries: where does untrusted data enter the system?
- Sensitive operations: auth, payments, data access, privilege escalation

## Step 2: Parallel audit lanes

Launch three independent subagents simultaneously using the Task tool. Each agent receives the attack surface from Step 1 and audits its domain in isolation.

**Agent 1 — Python vulnerability scan**: Scan for dangerous deserialization (`pickle.loads`, `yaml.load` without `Loader=`), code execution sinks (`eval`, `exec`, `shell=True`, `os.system`), path traversal (unvalidated `open()` paths), and insecure temp files (`tempfile.mktemp`, hardcoded `/tmp/`).

**Agent 2 — OWASP Top 10 checklist**: Evaluate against A01 (Broken Access Control), A02 (Cryptographic Failures), A03 (Injection), A04 (Insecure Design), A05 (Security Misconfiguration), A06 (Vulnerable and Outdated Components — cross-check `pip-audit` results against known CVE databases), A07 (Authentication Failures), A08 (Software and Data Integrity Failures — run `pip-audit`, `safety scan` \[run `safety --help` to confirm current subcommand; v3+ uses `scan`, v2 uses `check`\]), and A09 (Logging Failures), and A10 (Server-Side Request Forgery — validate all outbound requests originating from user-supplied URLs; flag `requests.get(user_url)` without allowlist). Return a checklist with pass/fail per item.

**Agent 3 — ML Security checks**: Audit supply chain for pre-trained models (source verification, checksum validation, pickle-based weight files), pickle usage in ML workflows (`torch.load`, `joblib.load` — check for `weights_only=True`; note: `weights_only=True` is the default in PyTorch 2.6+, so flag only if explicitly set to `False` or the project targets PyTorch < 2.6), model poisoning risks (data provenance, federated learning defenses), adversarial input validation (image dimensions/dtype, text length, LLM prompt injection defenses).

## Step 3: Report

```
## Security Audit: [target]

### Critical (exploitable, fix immediately)
- [vuln] at [file:line]
  Risk: [what an attacker can do]
  Fix: [specific remediation]

### High (fix before next release)
- [vuln] at [file:line]
  Fix: [specific remediation]

### Medium (fix within sprint)
- [vuln] at [file:line]
  Fix: [specific remediation]

### Informational (harden when convenient)
- [finding]

### Dependency Scan
Run: pip-audit && safety scan
Results: [paste output or "clean"]

### Supply Chain Security

- [ ] Dependencies pinned with hashes (uv pip compile --generate-hashes)
- [ ] GitHub Actions pinned to SHA (not just @v4 tag — tags can be moved)
- [ ] SLSA provenance: consider sigstore for signing release artifacts
- [ ] No install-time code execution (setup.py → pyproject.toml migration)
- [ ] Lockfile committed and CI uses --frozen / --locked

### ML Security

- Model sources: [trusted/untrusted]
- Pickle usage: [none/flagged locations]
- Input validation: [present/missing]
```

After printing the report above, write the full content to `tasks/output-security-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md` using the Write tool and notify: `→ saved to tasks/output-security-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md`

## Step 4: Delegate mechanical fixes (optional)

For `critical` and `high` findings with an unambiguous, targeted fix, Codex can implement the mechanical parts without human judgment.

**Delegate to Codex when the fix is specific and unambiguous:**

- Dangerous API call replaced with a safe equivalent (e.g., `yaml.load` → `yaml.safe_load`, `torch.load` without → with `weights_only=True`)
- Missing input validation guard added at a known entry point
- Hardcoded secret replaced with a config/env lookup at a specific location

**Do not delegate:**

- Access control redesigns, auth system changes, or any fix requiring architectural judgment
- Any finding where the correct fix is not immediately clear from the report

For each finding, read the vulnerable code, form an accurate brief, then spawn:

```
Task(
  subagent_type="general-purpose",
  prompt="Read .claude/skills/codex/SKILL.md and follow its workflow exactly.
Task: use the <agent> to <fix description with file:line, the vulnerable pattern, and the safe replacement>.
Target: <file>."
)
```

Example prompt (split by role): first `"use the sw-engineer to replace yaml.load(f) with yaml.safe_load(f) in src/loader.py:42"`, then `"use the qa-specialist to add a test confirming that a crafted YAML with !!python/object tag raises SafeError instead of executing code"`

The subagent handles pre-flight, dispatch, validation, and patch capture. If Codex is unavailable it reports gracefully.

Append a `### Codex Delegation` line to the audit output if this step ran.

</workflow>

<notes>

- Focus on exploitable issues, not theoretical risks — every finding must have a concrete attack scenario
- Run `pip-audit` and `safety scan` when dependency scanning; note if they're not installed
- For ML code: always check `torch.load` for `weights_only=True` and flag pickle-based weight files
- Follow-up chains:
  - Mechanical fixes (API substitutions, safe-flag additions) → Step 4 auto-delegates to Codex
  - Complex fixes (auth redesign, access control changes) → `/fix` to apply with regression tests
  - If fixes touch auth/input handling, re-run `/security` on the specific changed files exactly once as a post-fix sanity check — do not chain further
