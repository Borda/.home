<objective>

Investigation-first debugging. Gather evidence, trace the data flow, form a confirmed root-cause hypothesis, write a regression test, then hand off to fix mode.

NOT for: `.claude/` config issues (use `/audit`); general unknown failures without a traceback (use `/foundry:investigate`).

</objective>

<!-- Agent Resolution: identical across all develop skills -->

## Agent Resolution

> **Foundry plugin check**: run `ls ~/.claude/plugins/cache/ 2>/dev/null | grep -q foundry` (exit 0 = installed). If the check fails or you are uncertain, proceed as if foundry is available — it is the common case; only fall back if an agent dispatch explicitly fails.

When foundry is **not** installed, substitute `foundry:X` references with `general-purpose` and prepend the role description plus `model: <model>` to the spawn call:

| foundry agent         | Fallback          | Model  | Role description prefix                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `foundry:sw-engineer` | `general-purpose` | `opus` | `You are a senior Python software engineer. Write production-quality, type-safe code following SOLID principles.` |

Skills with `--team` mode: team spawning with fallback agents still works but produces lower-quality output.

**Task hygiene**: Before creating tasks, call `TaskList`. For each found task:

- status `completed` if the work is clearly done
- status `deleted` if orphaned / no longer relevant
- keep `in_progress` only if genuinely continuing

**Task tracking**: immediately after Step 1 (scope is known), create TaskCreate entries for all steps of this workflow before doing any other work. Mark each step in_progress when starting it, completed when done.

# Debug Mode

## Step 1: Understand the symptom

Collect all available signals before forming any hypothesis:

```bash
# Read the full traceback — never just the last line
python -m pytest --tb=long <test_path >-v 2>&1 | tail -60
```

```bash
# What changed recently near the failing code?
git log --oneline -20
git diff HEAD~5..HEAD -- <suspect_file>
```

If a GitHub issue number was provided:

```bash
gh issue view <number >--comments
```

Use Grep (pattern: failing symbol, class, or error keyword; path: `src/`) to trace the call path from entry point to failure site.

Spawn a **foundry:sw-engineer** agent to map the execution path and produce:

- Entry point to failure: which modules does the call cross?
- What state is mutated along the way?
- What invariant is violated at the point of failure?
- Any recent commit that touched this path (from git log output)

**Scope gate**: if the root cause spans 3+ modules, flag the complexity smell. Use `AskUserQuestion` to present the scope concern before proceeding, with options: "Narrow scope (Recommended)" / "Proceed anyway".

Present the agent's analysis summary before proceeding.

## Step 2: Pattern analysis

Find the nearest similar working code path and compare exhaustively:

1. Locate 2-3 code paths that handle similar input or perform similar work *successfully*
2. List **every** difference between the working path and the broken one — not just the obvious one
3. Check across axes:
   - Same input, different environment (versions, config, data shape)?
   - Same logic, different call order or timing?
   - Conditionals that take different branches on different inputs?
   - None/empty guards present in the working path but absent in the broken one?

This step catches non-obvious causes — an ordering dependency, environment-specific state, a type coercion that silently changes behaviour.

## Step 3: Hypothesis and gate

State the root cause hypothesis explicitly before writing any code:

```
Root cause: <one sentence — what is wrong and why>
Evidence for: [signals that support this]
Evidence against: [anything that contradicts or remains unexplained]
Confidence: high / medium / low
```

**Gate**: present this to the user and wait for confirmation or challenge before proceeding to Step 4. A wrong hypothesis produces a fix that passes tests but does not resolve the underlying problem.

If confidence is low: propose a targeted probe (a minimal script, an added log statement, a single assertion) to gather the missing signal — run it before committing to a fix.

## Step 4: Hand off to fix

Root cause confirmed. Transition to fix mode with the diagnosis as input — fix's Step 1 is pre-answered.

Emit this handoff block:

```
Root cause: <confirmed hypothesis from Step 3>
Suspect file(s): <files identified in Steps 1-2>
Evidence: <key signals that confirmed the hypothesis>
```

-> Proceed with `/develop:fix` from **Step 2** (regression test). The root cause is already known — fix's Step 1 analysis is complete.

Read `.claude/skills/_shared/quality-stack.md` and execute the Branch Safety Guard, Quality Stack, Codex Pre-pass, Progressive Review Loop, and Codex Mechanical Delegation steps.

## Team Assignments

**When to use team mode**: root cause unclear after Step 2, OR failure spans 3+ modules.

- **Teammate 1-3 (foundry:sw-engineer x 2-3, model=opus)**: each investigates a distinct root-cause hypothesis independently

**Coordination:**

1. Lead broadcasts current evidence: `{symptom: <description>, traceback: <key lines>}`
2. Each teammate claims one hypothesis and investigates it independently — no overlap
3. Lead facilitates cross-challenge between competing analyses
4. Lead synthesises the consensus root cause, then executes Steps 3-4 (hypothesis gate, hand off to fix) alone

**Spawn prompt template:**

```
You are a foundry:sw-engineer teammate debugging: [symptom].
Read ~/.claude/TEAM_PROTOCOL.md — use AgentSpeak v2 for inter-agent messages.
Your hypothesis: [hypothesis N]. Investigate ONLY this root cause.
Report findings to @lead using deltaT# or epsilonT# codes.
Compact Instructions: preserve file paths, errors, line numbers. Discard verbose tool output.
Task tracking: do NOT call TaskCreate or TaskUpdate — the lead owns all task state. Signal completion in your final delta message: "Status: complete | blocked — <reason>".
```
