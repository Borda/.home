# Shared Quality Stack

Used by develop mode skills (feature, fix, refactor, debug). Invoked via `Read(".claude/skills/_shared/quality-stack.md")`.

Skip the branch safety guard in `plan` mode — plan makes no code changes.

## Branch Safety Guard

```bash
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)                                                         # timeout: 3000
DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@') # timeout: 3000
if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "$DEFAULT_BRANCH" ] || [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "main" ] || [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "master" ]; then
    echo "⚠ On default branch ($CURRENT_BRANCH) — create a feature branch before running /develop"
    exit 1
fi
```

If the guard fires: stop, report the branch name, and ask the user to create a feature branch.

## Quality Stack

Run after all mode-specific steps complete:

```bash
# Linting and formatting
uv run ruff check <changed_files> --fix  # timeout: 30000
uv run ruff format <changed_files>  # timeout: 30000

# Type checking
uv run mypy <changed_files> --no-error-summary 2>&1 | head -30  # timeout: 30000

# Full test suite
uv run pytest <test_dir> -v --tb=short -q  # timeout: 600000

# Doctests (if applicable)
uv run pytest --doctest-modules <target_module> -v 2>&1 | tail -20  # timeout: 600000
```

Spawn a **foundry:linting-expert** agent if mypy or ruff issues require non-trivial fixes.

## Codex Pre-pass

Mandatory after the quality stack completes. Gracefully degrades if Codex is unavailable.

Read `.claude/skills/_shared/codex-prepass.md` and run the Codex pre-pass on the changes.

### Codex pre-pass: additional inline steps (step 1 is in the shared file)

2. **Collect findings**: build `CODEX_FINDINGS` — a bullet list of every flagged issue from the `codex:review` output. If nothing was found or the step was skipped, set `CODEX_FINDINGS=""`. The review is read-only — no working-tree changes are made.
3. **Co-authorship rule**: add `Co-Authored-By: OpenAI Codex <codex@openai.com>` to the commit only when Codex finds real issues that are subsequently fixed (either by Claude acting on the findings, or via later `codex:codex-rescue` delegation). Do NOT add it when Codex found no issues or was skipped.

Include a `### Codex Pre-pass` section in the final report:

- Available + findings: list what Codex flagged (these become the `CODEX_FINDINGS` seed)
- Available + no issues: "Codex pre-pass: no issues found"
- Skipped (unavailable): "codex plugin (openai-codex) not installed — pre-pass skipped"

## Progressive Review Loop

Maximum 3 cycles. Applied after the quality stack.

**Cycle 1: Full review**

- Invoke `/oss:review` for a full multi-agent code review. If `CODEX_FINDINGS` is non-empty, prepend it to the review brief: "Codex pre-pass found the following — verify these, do not rediscover: $CODEX_FINDINGS"
- Capture review state: `{agents_with_findings, unresolved_findings, files_reviewed}`
- If clean (no critical/high findings): skip to report

**Cycle 2: Targeted re-check**

- Fix critical/high findings from Cycle 1
- Re-run quality stack on modified files only
- Set up a run directory for file-based handoff: `RUN_DIR=".developments/$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H-%M-%SZ)"; mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR"`
- For each agent type in `agents_with_findings`: spawn that agent directly (not `/oss:review`) with a focused prompt scoped to modified files + prior findings. Each agent prompt must end with: "Write your full findings to `$RUN_DIR/<agent-name>.md` using the Write tool. Return ONLY a compact JSON envelope: `{\"status\":\"done\",\"findings\":N,\"severity\":{\"critical\":N,\"high\":N,\"medium\":N,\"low\":N},\"file\":\"$RUN_DIR/<agent-name>.md\",\"confidence\":0.N,\"summary\":\"<agent-name>: N critical, N high\"}`"

Replace bare agent names in spawn prompts with their `foundry:` prefixed equivalents: `foundry:sw-engineer`, `foundry:qa-specialist`, `foundry:linting-expert`, `foundry:doc-scribe`, `foundry:perf-optimizer`, `foundry:solution-architect`.

**Health monitoring** (CLAUDE.md SS8): after spawning, create a checkpoint:

```bash
DEVELOP_CHECKPOINT="/tmp/develop-check-$(date +%s)" # timeout: 5000
touch "$DEVELOP_CHECKPOINT"                         # timeout: 5000
```

Every 5 min:

```bash
COUNT=$(find "$RUN_DIR" -newer "$DEVELOP_CHECKPOINT" -type f | wc -l) # timeout: 5000
touch "$DEVELOP_CHECKPOINT"                                           # refresh — next poll detects only new writes, not old ones  # timeout: 5000
```

`COUNT == 0` -> stalled; `COUNT > 0` -> alive. Hard cutoff: 15 min with COUNT == 0 -> timed out.

- Skip agents that were clean in Cycle 1
- Collect envelopes to update review state (do not read the full finding files into context — check envelopes to determine if critical/high remain)

**Cycle 3: Minimal verification**

- Fix remaining critical/high findings
- Re-run quality stack only (no agents)
- If clean: proceed to report
- If still failing: stop and present findings to user — do not loop further

**Context optimization between cycles**:

- If context usage is high, write review state to `.claude/state/develop-review-state.md` before any compaction:
  ```
  # Develop Review State
  cycle: <N>
  resolved: [list]
  unresolved: [list]
  files_modified: [list]
  agents_with_issues: [list]
  ```
- After compaction, read it back to resume at the correct cycle
- Delete the file when the review loop completes

## Codex Mechanical Delegation

Read `.claude/skills/_shared/codex-delegation.md` and apply the delegation criteria. Delegate mechanical follow-up tasks to Codex when an accurate, specific brief can be written.

This step is distinct from the Codex pre-pass above — the pre-pass checks the implementation diff for correctness; mechanical delegation outsources low-level follow-up work (scaffolding, boilerplate, migration scripts, etc.) after the review loop closes.

Only include a `### Codex Delegation` section in the final report when tasks were actually delegated — omit entirely if nothing was delegated.
